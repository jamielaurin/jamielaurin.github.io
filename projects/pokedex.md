Throughout my ICS 211 class we had worked in various groups to create projects which were built on top of another. In the beginning of the semester we created various Pokemon objects who had multiple constructors and methods based on the Pokemons' stats and info. We then went on to incorportating inheritance to our project, which is a important part of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). We did this by allowing the next evolution of the pokemon to inherit all characteristics from the previous. Through this experience I had the chance to work with mutilple people throughout the semester. It was the first time we had made use of git and github to complete these group projects. Which made me realize that when it comes to software development, teamwork very important.
