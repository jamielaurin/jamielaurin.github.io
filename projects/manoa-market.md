Manoa Market is a web application that I helped create as a team project in ICS 314, Fall 2022. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site. <strong>Live Website:</strong> <a href="http://137.184.236.187/">Manoa Market</a>

Manoa Market was implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. We created a website that implements several types of listings including books, furniture, electronics, and etc.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/getting-started/introduction) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
