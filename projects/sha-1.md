The final project of my ICS 212 class was to implement a SHA-1 algorithm. We had the opportunity to be introduced to hash algorithms, which is a important component in computer security. There were alot of conceptual aspects introduced such as padding binary messages with zeros until its length is 512 mod 488. This was very important since each message digest will always output a 40 digit value. By padding it allows for any message no matter the length it may be, to be divided evenly in a uniform way as it outputs the message digest.
