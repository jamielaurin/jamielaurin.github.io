## The Power of Asking the Right Questions

"There's no such thing as a stupid question." This is a statement which I've heard being thrown around countless times throughout my life. It wasn't until recently I've realized the way we ask questions generate a specific response from others. From our tone, use of language, accessibility to ask/answer questions, and even to how explicit we are regarding the subject matter, etc. Depending on the questions we ask, it determines the information we receive back. Asking questions at random with no thought will not necessarily benefit a person. We may receive answers which we had not intended to hear or that are off topic. The quality of questions asked will affect the quality of the response given.
