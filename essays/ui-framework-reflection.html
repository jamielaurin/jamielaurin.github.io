<h2 id="ui-frameworks">UI Frameworks?</h2>
<p>Behind every website lies a combination of HTML and CSS. Conceptually, using HTML &amp; CSS may be easy for someone to understand. However, using only HTML and CSS files to create a decent-looking website is much more complicated than it seems. This brings us to the importance of UI Frameworks. Why exactly? UI Frameworks are a set of classes and interfaces that can be built upon further. It serves as a foundation for programmers so that we donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Nine lines of CSS code can be compacted into one or two lines by simply using the classes and features provided by frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>Personally, it has been my first time creating web interfaces this past week, and I found UI Frameworks to be extremely helpful in the process. It saves a lot of time off of CSS coding so that the creator may focus on more complicated features they may want to include on their interface. The UI I had been introduced to and used is Bootstrap 5 to enhance our projects visually in class. I found that Bootstrap had a lot of great uses, from its classes to commonly used icons readily available for users to utilize. I honestly loved my experience with Bootstrap. The interfaces I created with Bootsrap looked aesthetically better than they would if I had coded everything purely from HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it Out!</h2>
<p>Would I recommend the use of UI Frameworks? For sure! The beauty of simplcity UI Frameworks provides to the beautiful interfaces which can be produced from them are worth it. I understand that various UI Frameworks are readily available online. Deciding which to use may not be obvious since each framework has its own set of classes and interfaces. However, I feel that exploring and figuring out which works well for you is worthwhile in the end.</p>
