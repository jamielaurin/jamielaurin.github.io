## The Power of Asking the Right Questions

"There's no such thing as a stupid question." This is a statement which I've heard being thrown around countless times throughout my life. It wasn't until recently I've realized the way we ask questions generate a specific response from others. From our tone, use of language, accessibility to ask/answer questions, to how explicit we are regarding the subject matter, etc. Depending on the questions we ask, it determines the information we receive back. Asking questions at random with no thought will not necessarily benefit a person. We may receive answers which we had not intended to hear or that are off topic. The quality of questions asked will affect the quality of the response given.

## "Smart" Questions!

StackOverflow has been a great resource to many programmers. It allows for fellow programmers to ask and answer ones' question regarding a specific concept or sample of code. 

In the following example, we will analyze a proper way to ask a question.

## Conclusion 

We gain valuable knowledge from questions we ask those with greater expertise. The way we ask question can shape our understanding of concepts. With proper judgement in the questions we ask, we will benefit so much more. It is especially important for software engineers to ask smart questions. When coding there's a lot of variables that play a part into a project. It is very important to get a second opinion to not only get the correct answer out of it, but to see another's perspective. There are so many which we can code a single program and when we get insight from another person it opens our perspective to the other possible ways to code.
