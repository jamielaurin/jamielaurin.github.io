Behind every website lies a combination of HTML and CSS. Conceptually, using HTML & CSS may be easy for someone to understand. However, using only HTML and CSS files to create a decent-looking website is much more complicated than it seems. This brings us to the importance of UI Frameworks. Why exactly? UI Frameworks are a set of classes and interfaces that can be built upon further. It serves as a foundation for programmers so that we donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Nine lines of CSS code can be compacted into one or two lines by simply using the classes and features provided by frameworks.

Personally, it has been my first time creating web interfaces this past week, and I found UI Frameworks to be extremely helpful in the process. It saves a lot of time off of CSS coding so that the creator may focus on more complicated features they may want to include on their interface. More specifically, we used Bootstrap 5 to enhance our projects visually in class. I found that Bootstrap had a lot of great uses, from its classes to commonly used icons readily available for users to utilize. I honestly loved my experience with Bootstrap. The interfaces I created with Bootsrap looked aesthetically better than they would if I had coded everything purely from HTML and CSS.

Would I recommend UI Frameworks? For sure! The beauty of simplcity UI Frameworks provides to the beautiful interfaces which can be produced from them are worth it. I understand that various UI Frameworks are readily available online. Deciding which to use may not be obvious since each framework has its own set of classes and interfaces. However, I feel that exploring and figuring out which works well for you is worthwhile in the end.
