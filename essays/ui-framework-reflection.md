Behind every website lies a combination of HTML and CSS. Conceptually, using HTML & CSS may be easy for a person to understand. However, using only HTML and CSS files to create a decent-looking website is much more complicated than it seems. This brings us to the importance of UI Frameworks. Why exactly? UI Frameworks are a set of classes and interfaces that can be built upon further. It serves as a foundation for programmers so that we donâ€™t have to start from scratch. Nine lines of CSS code can be compacted into one or two lines by simply using classes and features provided through various frameworks.

Personally, it has been my first time creating web interfaces this past week, and I found UI Frameworks to be extremely helpful in the process. It saves a lot of time off of CSS coding so that the creator may focus on other complicated features they want to include on their interface. More specifically, we used Bootstrap 5 to enhance our projects visually. I found that Bootstrap had a lot of great uses, from classes to icons readily available.
