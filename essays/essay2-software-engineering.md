# Finding my way 
Fresh out of highschool, I was just as confused about my future like any other 18 year old. I hadn't given much thought about what I wanted do for the "rest of my life". I took a bunch of science and math classes when I first started college just because I excelled in those subjects more in highschool. But I still hadn't figured out what I wanted to do. One summer, out of curiosity I took a CS class to get a feel of the field and it was the first time I was geniunely interested in learning something. I guess looking back I had always been curious about the way things are created or made. It felt satsifying understanding bit by bit how computers work and it's interface. Especially since our world literally revolves around technology, and it's constantly growing and changing before our eyes. I felt that I wanted to be in this field to see it happen with my own eyes. 

# Aspirations 
I'm still fairly new to coding and as I get introduced to more languages I find myself more knowledgeable yet lost. My main goal in software engineering is definitely to gain strong fundamentals, so that way I'd be able to translate my code in any of the languages out there. I also want to gain more critical thinking skills when it comes to solving problems, which WODs (Work out of the Day) has been challenging me on. Critical thinking and coding do come hand in hand with one another for sure, it challenges us to solve problems more efficently. I also learned that software engineering is not limited as I originally thought. There is also creative side to it which catches my attention greatly. I look forward to diving into VR, AR , Game and Web Development as I learn more.
